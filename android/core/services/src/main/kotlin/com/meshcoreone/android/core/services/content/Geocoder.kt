// PortedFrom: MC1/Services/Geocoder.swift@db14559b39d32322b06477c6ae676112f583db50
// The Swift original is a thin `Sendable` protocol wrapping `CLGeocoder` so `RegionResolver`
// can depend on a `GeocodeResult` value type instead of an un-constructible `CLPlacemark`.
// Android's reverse-geocoding equivalent (the platform `location.Geocoder` class) is likewise a narrow
// native-adapter role (deferred - see docs/android/deviations/WP-218.md); this file ports only
// the pure role interface and the value type, exactly as the source does. There is no
// orchestration logic to port here (unlike LocationService) - that stays entirely with the
// future native adapter and RegionResolver's own consumer, matching the source split.
