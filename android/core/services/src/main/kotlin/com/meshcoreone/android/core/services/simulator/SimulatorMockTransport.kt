/**
 * Mock transport for simulator connections: a minimal stub that fulfills [MeshTransport] but never
 * communicates with a device. Sends are accepted and dropped while connected; nothing is ever received.
 *
 * It implements [MeshTransport] directly rather than reusing the protocol module's test `MockTransport`,
 * because Swift's stub differs from it in two observable ways that are kept here: a send while disconnected
 * fails with [MeshTransportError.NotConnected] (not `MockTransportException`), and the received stream is
 * created once and finished for good by the first [disconnect] (a later [connect] does not reopen it).
