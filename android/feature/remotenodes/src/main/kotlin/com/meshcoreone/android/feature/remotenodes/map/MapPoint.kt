 * Engine-free map pin (Swift `MapPoint`). Equality compares every field, as the Swift `==` does.
 *
 * Deviation: Swift stores the midpoint badge as a formatted `badgeText: String`. Logic here cannot
 * resolve the localized `dB` unit or read the device locale, so [badge] carries the badge inputs and
 * the renderer formats them with [SnrBadge.text]; equal inputs still mean equal points.
 *
 * [hopIndex] is the point's generic integer channel: repeater-hop styles carry their hop there and
 * location-fix dots their recency bucket.
