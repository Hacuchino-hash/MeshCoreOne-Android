# WP-204 implementation and verification record

**Status: actual owned unit/source verification passed113/113; shared
checksums/consumer locks are admitted and generated. Final integration is
BLOCKED by512MiB local D8 heap exhaustion and the still-unmerged WP-201 root
collector repair during the initial checkpoint. That repair is now actually
merged; final normal same-head root/APK/both-host verification is pending.
No actual APK or both-host root result is claimed yet.**

## Source/API/error map

| Owned source | Native surface | Original declaration evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MC1/Models/DevicePreferenceStore.swift` | DevicePreferenceStore, GPSSource, literal uppercase-UUID keys, immutable device snapshots; real shared DataStore reads/updates/observation/reset | DevicePreferenceSourceTest has all7 original cases; native boundary cases cover unknown/present GPS, reopen and reset separation |
| `MC1Services/.../Services/AppStorageKey.swift` | All48 AppStorageKey definitions, PreferenceValue/PreferenceSnapshot/PreferenceEditor, PreferenceStore, notification/appearance consumers and backup presence seam | Literal/raw/default/type/cold-start/reset/ordered-array/source-policy boundary assertions; no arbitrary replacement settings |
| `MC1Services/.../Services/SceneStorageKey.swift` | SceneStorageKey.MAP_CAMERA_REGION and ScenePreferenceStore, per-scene persisted default-empty string | Separate scenes, reopen, reset and exclusion from manual app-preference snapshot |
| `MC1Services/.../Services/KeyGenerationService.swift` | KeyGenerationService, SecureSeedSource, GeneratedIdentity, expanded import validation/public matching; four source failure families plus native InvalidPrefix guard | KeyGenerationSourceTest has all25 original declarations/32 parameter-expanded scenarios; independent RFC8032 seed/public and single SHA512 expansion assertion |
| `MC1Services/.../Services/KeychainService.swift` | SecretStore password store/retrieve/delete/has, source service/base64 account, stable radio partition, AndroidKeystoreCryptography and real FrameworkKeystoreKeyAccess | Actual DataStore/JCA boundary tests declare namespace, typed availability/loss/invalidation/authentication/version/IO, nonce/AAD, concurrent creation, rotation/deletion/cancellation and durability assertions |
| `MC1Services/Tests/.../PersistenceKeysThemeTests.swift` | PersistenceKeysSourceTest consumes the actually merged model constants and datastore appearance definitions | Both2 exact bare-name/no-prefix cases |
| `MC1Services/Tests/.../Services/KeyGenerationServiceTests.swift` | KeyGenerationSourceTest | All25 source identities, both three-row vanity families and four-row invalid-length family; none excluded |
| `MC1Tests/Models/DevicePreferenceStoreTests.swift` | DevicePreferenceSourceTest | All7 source identities, none excluded |

Every production/test Kotlin file has an owned pinned PortedFrom or AndroidOnly
disposition. Native tests currently declare the34 original cases and41 source
parameter scenarios; **declarations do not count as execution**.
[`collect_evidence.py`](collect_evidence.py) validates all8 inputs/blobs, the
trusted WP-004 literal family rows and complete actual native JUnit set.
Missing/malformed/zero/failed/skipped XML fails; it does not produce a
`local-evidence.json` pass while native execution is absent.
There are now **113 actual discovered/passed native methods**, one more than the112-method
checkpoint: the added owner-close cancellation case prevents a cancelled close
from leaving a permanently registered closed DataStore owner.
All113 execute with0 failures/errors/skips. One accidentally nested concurrency
method was absent from the first112-case runner output; the collector rejected
that mismatch, the method was moved into the actual JUnit class, and its
assertions now execute. No expectation or coverage count was weakened.
Complete verbatim local XML is retained in [`local-junit/`](local-junit/).
Native input hashes and whether those inputs match the observed Git HEAD are
recorded; local execution during uncommitted implementation is not mislabeled
as immutable hosted same-head authority.

`StorageFailure` distinguishes first-unlock, current lock, inaccessible user
storage, permission, IO, preferences/state/envelope corruption, GCM
authentication, missing formerly-used key, permanently invalidated key, corrupt
native key type, provider failure, unsupported version, oversize, owner lifetime
and input errors. `StorageOperation` preserves read/write/delete/rotation/export
context and causes. `StoreState` exposes loading/ready/failure without durable
empty replacement. Only absent secret entries return null/false.

## Actual commands and results so far

Commands run from the owning repository worktree. Private absolute toolchain/
cache paths are intentionally not committed; the actual provisioner's own
environment.json and logs remain in this session's artifact directory.

Gradle uses its actual checksum-pinned9.8.0 wrapper and AGP9.4.1 built-in Android
Kotlin, existing2.3.20 compiler/coroutines1.10.2/BC1.86, one worker/in-process
Kotlin,512MiB build heap/512MiB metaspace and256MiB test heap/metaspace,
SerialGC/two CPUs. Provisioning used only the trusted pinned archives; no
unversioned SDK CLI/helper bootstrap, global installation/cache/credentials,
third-party source upload, checksum weakening or signing operation occurred.

## Concrete remaining admission and execution

The initial receipt leases `android/core/datastore/`, this evidence subtree and
`docs/android/deviations/WP-204.md`; the later amendment adds only the exact
app BSD notice path below. New DataStore is absent from the actual
merged catalog/verification metadata. The module uses an independently
inspected exact1.2.1 coordinate without editing the shared catalog.
[`dependency-admission.json`](dependency-admission.json) records actual strict
failure artifact identities and independently checked publisher SHA256 values.

Root `android/gradle/verification-metadata.xml` is now exclusively leased to
WP-204 through the concrete serialized amendment. The frozen WP-205
XML-only handoff was checked by actual Git blob/complete SHA256/size and by
its actual PR comment; all6 SDK32/33/37 JAR/POM entries are retained. Its
serialized admission covers actual DataStore/Okio
metadata/binaries, runtime proto/shaded notices and any actually resolved JSON
transitive/POM inputs. Normal integration also requires narrowly admitted
`android/gradle/dependency-locks/app.lockfile` and the actual core:data lock,
coordinated with WP-202. The actual narrowly admitted locks and owned
`gradle.lockfile` are generated by real successful Gradle resolution, not
handwritten from artifact summaries. WP-202 now owns its separate local
core:data lock, not this shared root lock. No other lock coordinate/content
delta was introduced. Gradle re-emitted existing unleased lock bookkeeping;
every such file was independently checked canonically identical to immutable
HEAD, with no unleased Git content diff.

The requested independently corroborated **actual binary and POM inputs** are
in [`publisher-inputs.json`](publisher-inputs.json):18 exact module/POM
publications plus the actually observed existing serialization1.7.3 BOM,
10 actually downloaded JAR/AAR byte counts/SHA256/SHA1 values,
Android/JVM variant attributes, declared dependencies/version constraints,
POM licenses and exact bundled copyright/license hashes. The initial18
compile-artifact failure is preserved separately rather than relabeled as a
complete runtime graph. Actual reports additionally request the already
source-declared serialization-JSON1.7.3 pair; no unpinned version was introduced.

The relocated protobuf publication is **BSD-3-Clause**, not Apache-only.
Its1434-byte embedded license is retained verbatim at the coordinator's exact
additional leased source path
`android/app/src/main/assets/licenses/DataStore-Protobuf-BSD-3-Clause.txt`.
The corresponding required APK path is
`assets/licenses/DataStore-Protobuf-BSD-3-Clause.txt`, bytes1434,
SHA256`a01b712fbb30f80b86851468b6fa58e80eab68f69f325e88bbc7ddf47cf1b063`.
That embedded text lacks a copyright header; it is **not** called a complete
copyright receipt on its own. Static ConstantValue fields in the actual
shaded RuntimeVersion class bind upstream protobuf4.28.2. The exact v28.2
tag/commit/license blob provides the1732-byte `Copyright 2008 Google Inc.`
license (SHA256`6e5e117324afd944dcf67f36cf329843bc1a92229a8cd9bb573d7a83130fea7d`)
in owned module asset
`assets/licenses/WP-204/Protobuf-v28.2-Copyright-LICENSE.txt`.
Both exact texts must be packaged; neither is substituted by a generic Apache
notice. No publisher artifact code was executed.

Owned module assets also retain the actual AndroidX license, Okio Apache license and copyright
lines extracted from its checksum-pinned3.9.1 source archive. The Okio POM's
`square/okio` origin currently redirects to `lysine-dev/okio`; the exact
annotated3.9.1 tag object, immutable commit and license blob/hash are recorded,
with no signature or human license approval claimed.

The exact DataStore core Android AAR **contains native code**:
`libdatastore_shared_counter.so` for arm64-v8a,armeabi-v7a,x86,x86_64.
Independent static input inspection records all4 hashes/byte sizes and every
ELF PT_LOAD alignment as16384. It is not native-free, loaded on a device or
hardware-certified. Final actual APK inspection must locate all4 packaged
libraries, reparse their actual ELF headers and run real `zipalign -P16`;
AGP stripping may change their byte hashes and is recorded, not treated as
an inferred hardware/native-load pass.

[`lock-admission.json`](lock-admission.json) retains the actual initial app/data
lock blob IDs/hash/bytes and all12 potentially relevant existing configurations
per module. The precise proposal is only8 runtime/lint configurations per
module: `debugRuntimeClasspath`, `releaseRuntimeClasspath`,
`debugUnitTestRuntimeClasspath`, `debugAndroidTestRuntimeClasspath`,
`debugLintChecksClasspath`, `releaseLintChecksClasspath`,
`debugUnitTestLintChecksClasspath`, `debugAndroidTestLintChecksClasspath`.
An actual delta must control final lock generation; this proposal does not
manufacture already-resolved lock state or authorize a blanket graph rewrite.
It distinguishes those frozen records from the actually inspected
debug runtime and compile reports. Runtime/lint lock updates, not a blanket
root dependency graph rewrite, used the subsequent serialized coordinator
admission. The generated actual deltas and complete selected graph are
retained in `lock-admission.json` and
[`resolved-dependency-graphs.tsv`](resolved-dependency-graphs.tsv).
The raw [`runtime-dependency-report.txt`](runtime-dependency-report.txt) and
[`compile-dependency-report.txt`](compile-dependency-report.txt) are verbatim;
their successful report-command exit codes do not hide FAILED runtime nodes.

: convention
compiler class loading failed despite the exact private compiler JAR hash/class
being valid; a PowerShell stacktrace-rendering process overflowed and only that
command tree was stopped; a subsequent exact JDK preflight failed before Gradle
and fresh PowerShell could not load CoreCLR. Once exact JDK startup recovered,
the bounded read-only reports above completed. No other process, global config,
verification pin or dependency version was changed to hide those failures.

The real `:core:datastore:testDebugUnitTest` is wired through
`:core:datastore:verifyPreferenceTests` into the existing `verifyScaffoldTests`
task, following the actual merged l10n/model/database pattern. Once admitted,
run the smallest actual module test/collector, then normal strict native
protocol/model/datastore/root graph/runtime resolution, actual APK/inspection
and lint; retain normal same-head Windows/Linux schema2 raw JUnit/input/run/
attempt/artifact replay, not legacy dummy counts. No completion, PR readiness,
hardware, real Keystore TEE, API37 device, full backup oracle, legal/signing or
release claim is made before those executions and coordinator exact-head review.

See [native deviations](../../deviations/WP-204.md). The unchanged app already
depends on datastore and disables automatic backup/extraction, but source
inspection does not substitute for the required final actual APK proof.
The owned `:core:datastore:verifyPreferencePackaging` task now also hooks into
`verifyScaffoldTests` and depends on the real `:app:assembleDebug`. It inspects
the actual binary manifest's `allowBackup=false`, binds its extraction-rule
resource ID to the real compiled XML, requires all cloud/device-transfer
storage-domain exclusions, checks the five exact packaged notices, all4
DataStore native ELF libraries and static APK zipalignment, and scans
actual DEX for test helpers/known test-only secrets. This task is implemented,
**not executed/passed**. No app source amendment is currently justified by
the existing disabled-backup/all-domain rules plus credential-protected
`noBackupFilesDir`; if actual packaging reveals a gap, the only proposed
source amendment paths are `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and
`android/app/src/main/res/xml/scaffold_data_extraction_rules.xml`, still read-only.
The original module/docs lease, exact app BSD notice path and exact root
verification XML/app/core:data lock paths are active under the serialized
receipts. Other root locks/catalog/workflows/build files, backup config and
app resources remain read-only. No source backup-rule rewrite is justified. The exact notice verifier is
wired into actual module `preBuild` and app `mergeDebugAssets`, avoiding a
Windows-checkout race without fetching or regenerating licensed contents
during a build.

The additional copyright-asset proposal is exactly the owned module path
`android/core/datastore/src/main/assets/licenses/WP-204/Protobuf-v28.2-Copyright-LICENSE.txt`,
1732 bytes, SHA256
`6e5e117324afd944dcf67f36cf329843bc1a92229a8cd9bb573d7a83130fea7d`,
from immutable upstream v28.2 license blob
`19b305b00060a774a9180fb916c14b49edb2008f`/commit
`9fff46d7327c699ef970769d5c9fd0e44df08fc7`. The actual shaded runtime class
fields are4/28/2, not an inferred generic version. This supplements, never
changes, the exact admitted1434-byte app BSD asset. Its provenance is
recorded for coordinator review; full legal/source obligations remain WP-503.

The exclusive bounded local slot was used for real113-case assertions, the
owned verifier and exact admitted lock resolution. APK D8 assembly exhausted
the512MiB budget in both the combined and fresh separated invocation, without
producing an APK. All own private Java processes are confirmed gone; the
worker gives back the local slot rather than increasing a budget, killing a
peer, disabling strict verification or claiming a packaged/hardware result.
The coordinator subsequently granted one more bounded owned-validation slot;
actual113-case and strict selected-graph proof passed on mergedfbb, with the
notice preBuild hook executing. Final actual APK/root/runtime/both-host proof
is now requested from normal isolated PR CI on that actual merged base. The
previous512MiB D8 failures remain retained, not relabeled as APK success.
No next work package, factory, agent, fleet, merge or approval was started.
