# WP-201 historical implementation and current validation

The implementation record below, including `local-evidence.json`, is historical:
it retains the original **80 inputs, 114 families and 215 native identities**.
It is not a newly executed result or the identity of a later worker.
Repository `cbattlegear/MeshCoreOne-Android`; original owner `data-persistence-engineer`.
Session `f7b1af4d-9429-49e8-bcb0-6e3cc11cd5de`; owning branch
`cbattlegear-potential-engine`. Clean initial base:
`47822de6ff8641a6d085baf0d4993aa3c792db8c`.
Coordinator-authorized final integration/publication base:
`0394b83c9b47fa0d7198e2d631f7ddb313cd370d`.
Read-only reference: `db14559b39d32322b06477c6ae676112f583db50`.
Canonical manifest:
`78a22920beaa5899f9618806b5cd2b27d50399a9b29b4d8dbd79f755717ec746`.
Semantic policy:
`56bdc53548bc86d631245795dfa38b4fc86048e0e7cbe1c7d5695879b035b42a`.

The kickoff is the exact all-write-path lease for model, contracts/domain,
database and these per-WP evidence/deviation paths. No live ledger, formal
review or protected approval is fabricated. Source/manifest/policy pins,
65 IDs/185 edges/eight human gates are unchanged. Implementation head and
normal hosted results bind through the actual PR rather than a self-referential
committed SHA.

## Implemented bounded scope

All **54 primary production + 14 test + 12 support inputs** are mapped in
[`local-evidence.json`](local-evidence.json), with immutable source blobs/hashes,
many-to-many native files, every original declaration/parameter family,
concrete passed testcase identity and exact JUnit file hashes. Header mapping
alone is not acceptance.

The pure JVM model contains full non-rendering DTOs/value utilities, original
defaults/raw values/units/options, source identity/hash algorithms, defensive
collections/binary values, source computed behavior and typed wire-field
policies. Neutral contracts include all thirteen persistence roles plus
current store extension methods, typed failures/tuples, process/radio/screen
seams and deliberate generic session-service factories. There is no fake
repository/ServiceContainer implementation or production testing dependency.

The actual initial Room database has **17 tables**, native version **1**,
identity `847554c8d7ca15f1f881ba6bccce4121`, every persistent source field, radio
keys/indexes, explicit nullable parent links, two real cascades, exact
seconds/nanoseconds, source global-cache/history exceptions and actual DAOs.
Its KSP export is
[`MeshCoreDatabase/1.json`](../../../../android/core/database/schemas/com.meshcoreone.android.core.database.MeshCoreDatabase/1.json).
Full repository/retention/adoption/delete/backup algorithms remain WP-202/203,
not unimplemented calls hidden behind a pretend store.

| Acceptance | Concrete evidence |
| --- | --- |
| WP-201-behavior | Immutable full-field DTO/Room round-trips, source computed cases, typed contract/sync/error metadata and real abstract repository boundaries |
| WP-201-boundaries | Radio isolation/upsert/Flow, foreign-key and primary-key failures/rollback/cancellation, shared-history deletion guard, original byte/UUID/width/date/legacy policies |
| WP-201-source-test-parity | Complete 114-declaration map: all114 source-behavior/native equivalents execute, including the real merged WP-103 resolver consumer |

Six Channel Codable cases are *field-policy equivalents*, not whole-envelope
compatibility. Twenty-three original persistence/ConnectionMethod cases run
actual native DAO/column equivalents, not WP-202 repositories. Seven
createDevice cases exercise the extracted actual pure source factory, not
a mock connection ceremony. Those distinctions are attached to each case.
The initially retained matchRegions integration now executes the actual merged
resolver and protocol RegionMatchResult; its temporary neutral projection was
removed rather than kept as a competing type.

## Actual commands and discovery

All Gradle invocations use `android\scaffold\invoke-gradle.ps1` with the existing
portable JDK21.0.12.1/SDK37.2 inputs, private per-session user/project/Android
caches, unchanged credential allowlist, one worker/in-process Kotlin,
512–768MiB build heap and 256MiB test heap/metaspace. No global host setup or
unpinned SDK CLI/package bootstrap occurred.

| Exact command/task arguments | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `python android\scaffold\check_environment.py` in the stripped declared environment | Passed exact JDK/SDK/license-presence/private-cache checks |
| `:core:model:dependencies :core:database:dependencies --write-locks --dependency-verification strict` | Passed owned local-lock generation with already admitted versions |
| `:core:database:assembleDebug :core:contracts:compileKotlin --write-locks --dependency-verification strict` | Passed real Room/KSP generation and Kotlin compilation; observed late androidApis lock state generated |

| `python docs\android\evidence\WP-201\collect_evidence.py --write` | Passed nonzero/unskipped XML discovery, all80 primary input mappings, 114 case accounting and actual17-table/two-FK schema checks |

Actual debug APK: `android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk`,
40,442,186 bytes; SHA256
`b95f51375da5906a703c6468ca88df3cb45f38bffdb9f1f9b2f96985714ef1ce`.
Package `com.meshcoreone.android.debug`, min31/target37. GPL/MIT/Apache pinned
notices retained; no fixture or imaginary connected/send/restore UI packaged.
This is not physical-device, signed-release or native16KiB certification.
The local evidence collector records raw XML and schema hashes; canonical-LF
schema hash permits only Git text newline normalization, never byte-value or
golden changes.

## Real failures repaired, not waived

The first compile exposed Kotlin's unavailable predicate split and AbstractMap
values-name collision; proper types/regex/backing names fixed them. A reified
intersection-array diagnostic was fixed with explicit Any? element type.
Source contract reflection now distinguishes compiler-generated static
default-argument bridges from actual abstract instance methods.

Real Room failures exposed generator-omitted JSON defaults and Windows
file-backed WAL VFS behavior. The assertions consume the actual generator
shape, and the file proof explicitly uses test-only TRUNCATE/native SQLite.
An invalid Closeable assumption was replaced by explicit awaited lifecycle
and finally-close. Actual row conflict/cancellation tests prove preserved
committed rows and absence of each uncommitted row, not a proxy count.

The real localized APK build caught conflicting PortedFrom/AndroidOnly
dispositions in owned files. These were repaired without changing the trusted
validator or localization tests; the same actual assembly then passed.
No zero/ignored suite, missing metadata, fake formal review, catch-all default,
shared pin advance or lowered golden was used.

Independent read-only review of frozen initial head
`4d7c428bf2b5a9012888a3e560b305f88b002cca` found three real defects. The new
`ReviewedSourceRegressionTest` reproduced **3 tests/3 failures** before repair
and **3 passed/0 failures/errors/skips** after the source-correct changes:
oldest-first redecryption preserves canonical path1A instead of newer2B;
direct timestamp correlation excludes a newer channel7-attributed row;
timestamp-zero fallback truncates full Unix fractions toward zero before
UInt32 checking, retaining normalized dates and max-UInt32 fractions. No
expectation, source/golden or unrelated query was changed to make them pass.

The first combined768MiB final retry hit shared-host native commit exhaustion
while starting the Room test JVM, not an assertion failure. The actual complete
45-case Room suite then passed alone at512MiB; the combined module verification
and collector also passed at512MiB without skipping or reducing any suite.

## Remaining external/consumer evidence

The coordinator-authorized module build-script hooks now attach the real model
and database suites plus `:core:database:verifyDomainRoomTests` to
`verifyScaffoldTests`, following the merged l10n pattern. The independent
collector fails on a missing, malformed, zero, skipped or unaccounted suite.
The coordinator-owned generic raw-module retention/reader amendment is
actually merged into the final0394b83 base. Schema2 normal hosted artifacts now
derive committed active-module test sources, retain complete raw XML/input
blobs and independently reparse their exact cases/counts/hashes. This same PR
must pass on the final repair head; a legacy-only green build is not retained
WP-201 original-case proof.

## Evergreen root validation and explicit writer audit

`verifyDomainRoomTests` still depends on the actual model, contracts and Room
unit runners and remains attached to `verifyScaffoldTests`. Its normal collector
command validates the **current immutable HEAD**, not every later repository
change against the original WP-201 publication base. A valid protocol,
repository, DataStore or other native-module successor is not a WP-201 writer
scope violation.

```powershell
python docs\android\evidence\WP-201\collect_evidence.py
python docs\android\evidence\WP-201\collect_evidence.py --output C:\absolute\private\current-domain-evidence.json
python docs\android\evidence\WP-201\collect_evidence.py --audit-writer-scope --base-sha <exact-requested-40-character-base>
python tools\android-port\controller\test_runner.py --quiet
```

Only the explicit audit applies the original writer scopes to the requested
ancestor base. There is no implicit historical base, and `--base-sha` alone
is rejected. The code owner/coordinator chooses the actual base for that
one-off audit; the root task does not request it.

Current output separates actual candidate HEAD/branch and, when an event
context is available, its real base/head/run/attempt from historical metadata.
Detached checkouts have no invented branch; local output claims no hosted
authority or unavailable session identity. The credential-stripped Gradle
child does not invent missing event metadata: the outer schema2 bundle binds
that same candidate's actual hosted run. `--write` is no longer supported:
current reports may be written only to an explicit absolute private path
outside the repository, never over the immutable historical record.

The frozen original 215 **identities**, not just counts, are a minimum; all
114 catalog family/source/blob/parameter identities and original DAO
annotation bindings remain mandatory. Extra executed tests are counted and
listed separately without fabricated source parity. Complete, nonzero,
unskipped raw XML is independently parsed using the existing CI helpers.
Missing, unsafe, malformed, duplicate, failed/error/skipped or inconsistent
suites fail. Current committed native source/build/schema and collector/catalog
inputs must match the checkout, including ignored uncommitted source files.
The pinned Swift reference remains read-only. Frozen Room v1 semantic content,
including every field and both exact cascade relationships, cannot change;
text CRLF/LF normalization is the only allowed checkout normalization.

`runtime_inputs.py` requires both this collector and its real temporary-Git/XML
regression suite in the committed candidate tree. Normal schema2 CI still
retains/reparses complete raw active-module suites and candidate input blobs;
this hook does not replace that evidence or upgrade historical schema1 proof.
No manifest, source, policy, production model/DAO/schema, dependency or
privileged workflow is changed by this integration repair.

See [deviations](../../deviations/WP-201.md) for explicit native adaptations.
Robolectric simulates API31; production AUTOMATIC/WAL on actual devices,
supported future Android upgrades and full persistence consumers remain their
actual owners. Initial v1 does not manufacture historical migrations.

The owned compression utility consumes the real WP-004 Swift raw-DEFLATE
artifact, matching the independent JSON bytes, high bits and Unix fractions.
This does **not** establish candidate-to-Swift export or bidirectional restore,
atomic import/preference completion, radio remapping, key loss/security,
hardware, licensing/signing or a feature-complete release.

WP-202 receives real rows/DAOs/checked mappings and full neutral interfaces;
WP-203 receives exact legacy/wire policies and raw framing; WP-207 receives
generation/factory/lifetime seams. Coordinator review/merge, not this worker's
test summary, controls their dispatch. No next work package is started here.
