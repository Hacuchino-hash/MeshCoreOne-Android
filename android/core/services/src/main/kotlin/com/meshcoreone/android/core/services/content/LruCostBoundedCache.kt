// Swift's `NSCache`-backed memory tier is explicitly documented upstream as "not a strict LRU"
// (Apple: the OS may evict any entry at any time), but its *intended* and observed shape - most
// recently touched entries survive memory pressure longest - is a genuine least-recently-used
// policy, not the insertion-order FIFO already ported for `DecodedPreviewCache`/`InlineImageCache`
// (see `FifoCostBoundedCache`'s own doc comment flagging this exact distinction). This type is
// that separate, LRU-shaped primitive: a `LinkedHashMap(accessOrder = true)`-backed cache that
// promotes an entry to most-recently-used on both read and write, evicting the least-recently-used
// entry first once either bound is exceeded.

/**
 * An LRU cache bounded by both entry count and total cost, mirroring the *intended* eviction
 * shape of `LinkPreviewCache`'s Swift `NSCache` memory tier (an `NSCache` has no formal LRU
 * contract, but unlike the hand-rolled FIFO caches elsewhere in this module, it promotes
 * recently-touched entries rather than always evicting oldest-inserted-first).
 *
 * Eviction removes the least-recently-used entry (by both read and write access) while there is
 * more than one entry and either bound is exceeded. The just-written entry is always kept even if
 * it alone exceeds [maxTotalCostBytes], matching [FifoCostBoundedCache]'s "a large hero is still
 * served once" guarantee.
 *
 * Not thread-safe by itself; use [ThreadSafeLruCostBoundedCache] for the lock-guarded shape the
 * original's actor-isolated `NSCache` access provides.
