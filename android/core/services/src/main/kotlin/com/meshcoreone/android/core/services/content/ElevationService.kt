// PortedFrom: MC1/Services/ElevationService.swift@db14559b39d32322b06477c6ae676112f583db50
// The source actor owns three concerns in one type: pure point-sampling/sample-count math,
// request-URL construction, and HTTP-with-retry-and-JSON-decode against Open-Meteo's bulk
// elevation endpoint. This port keeps the first two pure JVM (and ports them against the
// source's exact thresholds/formulas) but defers HTTP execution AND response JSON decoding to an
// injected [ElevationFetching] role: the Android-compatible HTTP backend (OkHttp proposal) is
// still pending coordinator sign-off (see docs/android/deviations/WP-218.md), and using
// kotlinx-serialization here would extend an admission scoped specifically to
// InlineImageDimensionsStore, not requested for this file. This port owns only the retry/backoff
// orchestration and request-parameter formatting, matching the source's own
// performRequest/parseElevationResponse split at the boundary where each attempt crosses into
// the native adapter.
//
// `fetchElevations`' per-sample `distanceFromAMeters` further depends on `RFCalculator.distance`,
// which the port-manifest assigns to WP-212 (RF/*, not yet merged) - not WP-218's concern. Rather
// than hand-duplicating great-circle distance math here (which would conflict with RFCalculator
// once it lands), that one calculation is injected as [distanceMeters], mirroring how
// [LocationProducing]/[Geocoder] defer to not-yet-existing platform/cross-WP roles.
//
// The source's own per-sample result struct, `ElevationSample`, is likewise NOT this file's to
// port: it is a shared RF-module type at `MC1Services/Sources/MC1Services/RF/ElevationSample.swift`,
// also assigned to WP-212 (cross-referenced by `RFCalculator`/`PathAnalysisResult`/etc). This port
// instead returns a WP-218-local [ElevationPathSample] shape, so as not to pre-empt WP-212's file
// under a borrowed name; unifying the two is WP-212's/an integration WP's concern.
