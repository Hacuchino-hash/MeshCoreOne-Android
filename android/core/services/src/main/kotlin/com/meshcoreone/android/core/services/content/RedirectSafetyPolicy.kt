 * that passed the initial `isSafe` check could redirect to a private host and still be
 * fetched anyway.
 *
 * This is a pure-JVM policy object, not a platform redirect-handling hook: the Android HTTP
 * adapter (outside `core:services`) is responsible for intercepting each redirect before
 * following it and calling [authorize] with the `Location` target, refusing the hop when the
 * result is `null` - mirroring the original's `URLSessionTaskDelegate` callback, which either
 * passed the redirect request through unchanged or returned `nil` to cancel it.
