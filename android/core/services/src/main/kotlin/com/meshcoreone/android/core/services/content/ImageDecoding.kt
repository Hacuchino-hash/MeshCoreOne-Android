// contract; the real decode/downsample/allocation producer is a native adapter in
// android/app/src/main/kotlin/.../app/content (see docs/android/deviations/WP-218.md). This role
// supplements -- does not replace -- ImageHeaderDecoder's pure hand-parsed header dimensions:
// ImageHeaderDecoder answers "what size is this, without touching the full bitmap" for the probe
// path, while ImageDecoding answers "produce the actual decoded/downsampled pixels" for the
// render path, matching the Swift original's two distinct call sites.
