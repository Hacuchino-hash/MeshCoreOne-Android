# Connection runtime

This module is part of the GPLv3 MeshCore One application. The application's
[`LICENSE`](../../../LICENSE) governs the runtime, including ported connection
error prose. It is not MIT protocol code. The separately licensed
`:core:protocol` dependency retains its own MIT notice.

Production dependencies are only `:core:protocol`, `:core:model` and
`:core:contracts`. Android persistence/BLE/CDM/FGS adapters and the concrete
WPs 208-218 graph are constructor/factory inputs supplied at WP-303.
No production test graph or default-success service is available.

`FactoryOwnership` must own allocations immediately and register the returned
handle before suspension. Generation-specific callbacks and scopes end with
that handle. Process preferences/repositories are never closed on a radio
disconnect. A retained physical link is recovery state, not a fresh protocol
generation; reacquisition awaits its real physical close.

Declared verification tasks are `test`, `resolveRuntimeDependencies`,
`verifyConnectionRuntimeTests`, `verifyRuntimeNativeIntegrationTests` and
`verifyRuntimeEvidenceReaders`. The owning module hooks join existing root
`verifyScaffoldTests`; no shared root task or production graph edge is added.
The dependency proposal runner invokes only `resolveRuntimeDependencies`.

Equivalent callers observe one submitted attempt; only its authoritative
revision owner may cancel it or clear its pending slot. A late diagnostic
failure remains visible to that caller without invalidating a successfully
completed shared generation. Cleanup always joins the owned operation and
retains original and suppressed failures.

With the existing CI's `wp207EvidenceDirectory` property, the hooks retain
the complete source-family/native assertion maps and raw XML/input bindings
in the external job artifact. Historical evidence never becomes current-head
acceptance merely because the file names or test counts are unchanged.

See [WP-207 evidence](../../../docs/android/evidence/WP-207/README.md) and
[native adaptations](../../../docs/android/deviations/WP-207.md) for exact
source revisions, original-family accounting and execution limits.
