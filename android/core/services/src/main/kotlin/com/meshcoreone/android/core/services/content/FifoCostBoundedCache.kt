// Generic extraction of the FIFO, count-and-cost-bounded eviction policy shared by
// DecodedPreviewCache's `mirror` and InlineImageCache's `decodedMirror`/`servesPageMirror` - all
// three are hand-rolled `[String: V]` dictionaries plus an explicit `insertionOrder` array under
// a lock, evicting oldest-first while keeping the just-inserted entry. This is NOT the same
// policy as LinkPreviewCache's `NSCache` memory tier: NSCache's internal eviction order is
// OS-managed/undocumented (Apple docs: "not a strict LRU"), not insertion-order FIFO, so it is
// deliberately NOT modeled by this type - LinkPreviewCache's own memory-tier port (not yet
// implemented) will need its own policy, most likely a `LinkedHashMap(accessOrder = true)`-backed
// LRU, not this FIFO primitive. This module owns only the pure, synchronous eviction algorithm;
// thread-safety is layered by [ThreadSafeFifoCostBoundedCache] and concrete payload types
// (android Bitmap-equivalent, network bytes, etc.) are narrow native-adapter responsibilities
// layered on top (see docs/android/deviations/WP-218.md).

/**
 * A FIFO cache bounded by both entry count and total cost, mirroring the hand-rolled
 * insertion-order eviction policy shared by `DecodedPreviewCache.mirror`,
 * `InlineImageCache.decodedMirror`, and `InlineImageCache.servesPageMirror`.
 *
 * Eviction is insertion-order FIFO (not true LRU - the originals never promote on read either):
 * entries are evicted oldest-first while there is more than one entry and either bound is
 * exceeded. The just-inserted entry is always kept even if it alone exceeds [maxTotalCostBytes],
 * matching the Swift comment "so a large hero is still served once."
 *
 * Not thread-safe by itself - the original types each wrap an equivalent single-threaded
 * structure under their own lock/actor (`OSAllocatedUnfairLock`). Use
 * [ThreadSafeFifoCostBoundedCache] to reproduce that wait-free-read, lock-guarded-write shape.
