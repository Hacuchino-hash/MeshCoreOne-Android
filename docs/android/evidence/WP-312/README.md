# WP-312 MapLibre/OpenFreeMap candidate evidence

**Status:** MapLibre/OpenFreeMap implementation candidate complete; hosted
exact-head checks remain the authoritative merge gate.

  service was added.

## Provider and dependency result

- Engine: `org.maplibre.gl:android-sdk:13.6.1`
- AAR SHA-256:
  `3863ef506991b590270e1418129a44b98d73da31251c011dc440ea6121fb01aa`
- Base style: `https://tiles.openfreemap.org/styles/liberty`
- Visible attribution: OpenFreeMap, © OpenMapTiles, © OpenStreetMap
  contributors, each linked from the map.
- Satellite: unavailable; OpenFreeMap supplies no satellite imagery.
- Topography: unavailable; no approved OpenFreeMap topo style is configured.

Selected additions in the strict `core-maps` graph are MapLibre Native 13.6.1,
MapLibre GeoJSON/Turf 6.0.1, MapLibre Gestures 0.0.4, Gson 2.10.1, OkHttp
4.12.0, Timber 5.0.1, AndroidX Fragment 1.8.9, CustomView/ViewPager 1.0.0 and
their already-admitted Kotlin/AndroidX support modules. The exact graph is in
`android/gradle/dependency-locks/core-maps.lockfile`; artifact checksums are in
`android/gradle/verification-metadata.xml`.

MapLibre Native and MapLibre Gestures are BSD-2-Clause. MapLibre GeoJSON/Turf,
Gson, OkHttp, Timber and AndroidX are Apache-2.0. The APK retains the existing
Apache notice and adds exact upstream BSD notices:

| Notice | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| `MapLibre-Native-BSD-2-Clause.txt` | `554cff8b6f6d2e77629e8c6eab769844ab86adc610ca2d60401ba2e0dce3c229` |
| `MapLibre-Gestures-BSD-2-Clause.txt` | `e82169bcba4d61ddb2d838aa154d153517e227efb07a60668efbcc472b18773f` |

OpenFreeMap code is MIT; the remotely served Liberty/OpenMapTiles/OSM resources
are not redistributed in the APK. Their required credits are visible on the
map. OpenFreeMap's official documentation states that its public instance has
no request limits and separately publishes weekly MBTiles/PMTiles/Btrfs
snapshots for self-hosting.

## Implemented behavior

- Lifecycle-correct Compose/MapView adapter using the Liberty base map.
- Real radio-partitioned contact/discovered-node loading from the process store.
- Stable GeoJSON point/line overlays, filters, labels, clustering/expansion,
  selection, refresh and an accessible node-list alternative.
- Persisted camera, cluster, label and filter preferences.
- Deep-link/message-location marker and camera focus.
- MapSnapshotter renderer with attribution and truthful offline unavailability.
- OfflineManager create/progress/pause/resume/delete lifecycle for the visible
  OpenFreeMap base-map region, with typed low-storage/network failures,
  cancellation cleanup, persisted metadata and destructive confirmation.
- Honest offline scope: MapLibre-managed base regions are supported; satellite,
  topographic and arbitrary local-MBTiles mounting are not claimed.

## Actual local verification

Using the repository launcher, checksum-pinned Temurin 21.0.12.1, SDK 37.2,
build-tools 37.0.0, explicit private caches and strict dependency verification:

| Command/check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `:app:compileDebugKotlin` | Passed |
| `:core:maps:testDebugUnitTest --rerun-tasks` | Passed: 19 discovered/run/passed in 3 suites; 0 failed/errors/skipped |
| `:app:testDebugUnitTest --rerun-tasks` with `-TestHeap 512m -TestMetaspace 768m` | Passed: 547 discovered/run/passed in 41 suites; 0 failed/errors/skipped |
| `:core:maps:lintDebug :feature:map:lintDebug :app:lintDebug` | Passed; no lint errors |

| `zipalign -c -P 16 4 app-debug.apk` | Passed |
| Repository `apk_alignment.inspect_alignment` | Passed for every packaged ELF: arm64-v8a and x86_64 MapLibre/AndroidX/DataStore `PT_LOAD` segments use `p_align=0x4000`; 32-bit ABIs are intentionally not packaged |

Built debug APK SHA-256:
`7892689C3EF38A70C12328E68E407FBFF67804B38B440E2C2A1E2C8747975C56`.
This is static packaging evidence, not execution on a 16 KiB device.

## Acceptance

| Acceptance | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `WP-312-behavior` | Implemented: base map, overlays, filtering, clustering, camera persistence/focus, snapshots, attribution and offline base-region lifecycle. Satellite/topographic absence is explicit. |
| `WP-312-boundaries` | Implemented/tested locally: no GPS permission dependency, cache/snapshot lifecycle, pause/resume/delete, network loss, cancellation, low disk and static 16 KiB packaging. Physical-device execution is not claimed. |
| `WP-312-source-test-parity` | Shared map algebra and snapshot/offline parameter families are covered by 19 nonzero JVM cases; feature-specific downstream map builders remain consumers of these WP-312 seams in their owning WPs. |

PR #140 may leave draft only after its exact-head hosted checks pass.
